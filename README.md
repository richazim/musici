# Music Player (Native)

This is a native music player application built with **Expo**, **React Native**, **TypeScript**, and **React-Redux**. The design takes inspiration from the **Apple Music** app, featuring a sleek and modern user interface.

## Features

- **Audio Playback**: Play your favorite tracks seamlessly.
- **Playlist Management**: Create and manage your playlists easily.
- **Favorites**: Mark and manage your favorite songs.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both iOS and Android devices.
- **Modern UI**: Clean and intuitive design inspired by Apple Music.

## Why I Built This

I created this project to better understand the functionality and implementation of audio players in mobile applications. Through this, I explored:
- How to handle audio playback using libraries like `react-native-track-player`.
- State management using `React-Redux`.
- Creating a user-friendly interface with **React Native**.
